# CompetitiveProgramming

cherry (Java): You are given n integers a1,a2,…,an. Find the maximum value of max(al,al+1,…,ar) ⋅ min(al,al+1,…,ar) over all pairs (l,r) of integers for which 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

infinity (Java): Find coordinates of a number on a grid with sequential numberering starting from top left, spiraling clockwise. 

round (Java): Rounds a number down to the nearest power of 10.

makeit (Java): You are given an array of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, and a set b of k distinct integers from 1 to n. In one operation, you may choose two integers i and x (1 ≤ i ≤ n, x can be any integer) and assign a i := x. This operation can be done only if i does not belong to the set b. Calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform so the array a is increasing (that is, a1 < a2 < a3 <⋯< an), or report that it is impossible.

ebony (Java): Given two numbers, can they combine to create a third given number.

arraydec (Java): Given two arrays, add 1 to each item in array b until it is equal to or greater than array a. If equal, return yes, if not return no.

medium (Java): Given three distinct numbers, return the middle number. 

makeAP(C++): Given three integers, multiple one by m to make an arithmetic progression, return Yes if an m is found or No. 

round (C++): Rounds a number down to the nearest power of 10.
